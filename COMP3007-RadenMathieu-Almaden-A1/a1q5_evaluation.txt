Question 5 a)

If the interpreter uses applicative-order evaluation, the behavior it'll showcase will be that (x) will be repeatedly called on itself. Meaning it'll go on infinitely.
This is because in applicative-order, you evaluate the variables/arguments first before doing any continuation
on the function/equation. Due to the definition of the (x) function, it causes itself to repeat on itself before the equation can continue.

b)

If the interpreter uses normal-order evaluation, the behavior it'll showcase is that it'll cause 1 to be returned because when calling (test 1 (x))
The if statement within the function will end up being evaluated to true because of how normal-order works. Expanding
the equation causes the function to be able to evaluate that if statement first before calling (x). Let alone (x) being called at all because of the
return value of 1.
